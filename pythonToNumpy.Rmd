Here are 100 numpy exercises: http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/numpy.100/index.html

3.1
The following code creates an array of ones that is 4,000,000 elements long and of datatype float32. All elements in this array are then set to zero.
By casting the array as a larger data type like float64, the computation speed increases by about 25%. But by casting the array as a byte array like
int8, speed is increased by about 50%.
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z = np.ones(4*1000000, np.float32)
Z[...] = 0
Z.view(np.float64)[...] = 0
Z.view(np.int8)[...] = 0
```

An array is mostly a contiguous block of memory whose parts can be accessed using an indexing scheme.
Such indexing scheme is in turn defined by a shape and a data type and this is precisely what is needed when you define a new array.
Because the items in the following array are of type int16, they each have a size of 2 bytes.
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3).astype(np.int16)
print(Z)
print(Z.itemsize) # size of each element
print(Z.shape) # array shape
print(Z.ndim) # number of dimensions in the array
```

Arrays are stored as contiguous blocks of memory, and the amount of memory to traverse in order to reach the next element is called a stride.
More info about strides: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.strides.html#numpy.ndarray.strides
In the following example array Z contains elements that are of type int16 meaning that each element takes up 2 bytes of data, meaning the entire array is 20 bytes.
Starting at the first element, in order to get to the next element, we need to skip 2 bytes, meaning that the stride length is 2.
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3).astype(np.int16)
strides = Z.shape[1]*Z.itemsize, Z.itemsize
print(strides)
print(Z.strides) # strides is already a built in function
```

With the information from strides, we can access a specific item using an index tuple using start and end offsets. The idea is that in the below vector each item will be
a stride of 2 bytes. So if we want to get to the third item we need a start_offset of 4 bytes and an end offset of 6 bytes. This will access the two bytes of the third item.
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3).astype(np.int16)
index = 1,1
offset_start = 0
offset_end = 0
print(Z)
print(Z[index])

offset = 0
for i in range(Z.ndim):
    offset_start += Z.strides[i]*index[i]
offset_end = offset_start + Z.itemsize
print(offset_start,offset_end)
V = Z[:2,::2]
print(V)
```

3.3 Views and Copies
Indexing arrays refers to any use of the square brackets ([]) to index array values. So this can simply mean accessing an element by its index. A simple example shown below is single element indexing.
Simple indexing will always show a view of the selected array, while advanced indexing will return an actual copy of the array.
```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(10)
print(x[2], x[-2])
```

Numpy arrays also support multidimensional indexing for multidimensional arrays. This means that each dimension does not need to be separated by its own set of brackets.
If the array is indexed using fewer dimensions than are contained in an array, like x[0] when there are two dimensions, an entire piece of the array is returned.
```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(10)
x.shape = [2,5] # x is now a 2-dimensional array
print(x)
print(x[1,3])
print(x[1][3]) # indexing can be separated into individual brackets
print(x[1,-1])
print(x[0]) # subdimensional array
```

Below illustrates the difference between indexing and fancy/advanced indexing.
```{python}
import numpy as np

# simple indexing
print('Simple Indexing')
Z = np.arange(9)
Z_view =Z[:3] # start at first element and go to the third
print('Z:')
print(Z)
print('Z_view')
print(Z_view)
Z_view[...] = 0 # this will modify the original array
print('Z:')
print(Z)

# fancy indexing
print('Fancy Indexing')
Z = np.arange(9)
Z_copy = Z[[0,1,2]]
Z_copy[...] = 1
print('Z:')
print(Z)
print('Z_copy:')
print(Z_copy)
```

In order to check whether the result of indexing is returning a view or a copy its base can be checked. If the base of an index is None, then the result is a copy.
The allclose function used below returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within some tolerance which is usually a very small number.
If either array contains one or more NaNs, False is returned, and Infs treated as equal if they are in the same place in both arrays.
```{python}
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(seed=5)
Z = np.random.uniform(0,1,(6,5)) # creates a uniform distribution with values from 0 to 1, with 6 rows and 5 columns
print(Z)

Z1 = Z[:3,:] # start from first row, include up to the third row, then include every column
Z2 = Z[[0,1,2], :] # include rows 0,1,2 and every column from those rows
print(np.allclose(Z1,Z2)) # check if the two arrays are equivalent

if Z1.base is Z:
    print('Z1 base is Z')
if Z2.base is Z:
    print('Z2 base is Z')
elif Z2.base is None:
    print('Z2 base is None')
```

Whether or not a particular numpy function returns a view or a copy is dependent on the function. Below, ravel() will return a view when possible, while flatten() will always return a copy.
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z = np.zeros((5,5))
print(Z.ravel().base is Z)
print(Z[::2,::2].ravel().base is Z)
print(Z.flatten().base is Z)
```

Temporary Copy
While copies of arrays can be done explicitly like in the case of fancy indexing, typically temporary or intermediate array copies are made
that are then re-assigned to the base array. A good example of this is when using arithmetic on an array. An intermediate array is made, multiplied (or whatever operation)
and then re-assigned to the base array.
In the below code snippet, an array copy is made to hold the result of 2*X, 2*Y, and A. When the arrays are small as they are in this example,
making an array copy will not significantly impact the runtime. However, if the arrays are large, this is not ideal.
```{python}
import numpy as np
X = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int)
Y = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int)
A = 2*X + 2*Y
print(A)
```

When the arrays are large, it is better to calculate the arithmetic without making an intermediate copy as shown below. In the code below, both X and Y are overwritten by the `np.multiply` methods, meaning that no new arrays need to be created in order to hold the new data which saves RAM and is faster than creating a new array.
```{python}
import numpy as np
X = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int)
Y = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int)
np.multiply(X, 2, out=X) # multiply and overwrite X
np.multiply(Y, 2, out=Y) # multiply and overwrite Y
np.add(X, Y, out=X)
print(X)
```

3.5 Conclusion
If we have two vectors Z1 and Z2 and we would like to know if Z2 is a view of Z1, and if so that that view is.
Z2 is created by accessing Z1 starting at element `1` and reading to element `-1` (not inclusive) by 'twos' so that every other element is aquired or Z1[start:stop:step]
```{python}
import numpy as np
Z1 = np.arange(10).astype(np.int16)
Z2 = Z1[1:-1:2]
print('The two arrays')
print(Z1)
print(Z2)

print('Is Z2 base Z1')
print(Z2.base is Z1)
step = Z2.strides[0] // Z1.strides[0]
print(step)

# now find the start and stop indices using byte_bounds with returns a pointer to the end-points of an array
offset_start = np.byte_bounds(Z2)[0] - np.byte_bounds(Z1)[0]
print(offset_start) # in bytes
```

4.1 Code Vectorization
Code vectorization is helpful when the problem to be solved is inherently vectorizable, because numpy is good at expediting this process.
Below is a simple example of how code can be vectorized.
The following example zips together two lists in which each corresponding element in the list is combined together, and then each of those pairs is added together.
```{python}
def add_python(Z1, Z2):
    return [z1+z2 for (z1,z2) in zip(Z1,Z2)]
x=add_python([1],[2])
print(x)
```

Using numpy the solution from above can be vectorized.
Using the numpy approach is an order of magnitude faster than using the first approach.
```{python}
import numpy as np
def add_numpy(Z1,Z2):
    return np.add(Z1,Z2)

x=add_numpy([1,2],[2,3])
print(x)
```

Not only is the second approach using numpy faster than the first approach, but it naturally adapts to the shape of Z1 and Z2.
For instance if Z1 and Z2 were both lists, the first approach would simply combine the lists rather than add the elements together.
Because numpy can adapt to the shape of Z1 Z2, even if Z1 and Z2 were lists, it would add the elements together.
In the following examples, the first concatenates the two lists together, the second concatenates the internal lists together, and
the last function adds the elements contained within the lists together.
```{python}
import numpy as np
# create Z1 and Z2 as lists
Z1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
Z2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

print('non-numpy approach')
print(Z1 + Z2)

print('still non-numpy approach')
def add_python(Z1, Z2):
    return [z1+z2 for (z1,z2) in zip(Z1,Z2)]
x=add_python(Z1,Z2)
print(x)

print('numpy approach')
def add_numpy(Z1,Z2):
    return np.add(Z1,Z2)
x=add_numpy(Z1,Z2)
print(x)
```
